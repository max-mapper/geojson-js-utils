GeoJSON Utilities for JavaScript
================================

Here you will find some functions to help you manipulate and work with GeoJSON
objects.

Some algorithms adapted from [bjwbell/canvas-geolib](https://github.com/bjwbell/canvas-geolib)

## How to use!

Load up in a browser OR `npm install geojson-utils`

```javascript
var gju = require('geojson-utils');
```

You now have an object named `gju` that contains all of the helper functions.

Remember, GeoJSON coordinates are ordered [x,y] or [longitude,latitude] to comply with the Open
Geospatial Consortium's recommendation!

## Line intersections

```javascript
gju.lineStringsIntersect({ "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[0, 2], [5, 2]] },
                 { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[3, 0], [3, 4], [4,4], [4,0]] })
// [{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2,3]},{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2,4]}]

gju.lineStringsIntersect({ "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[0, 2], [5, 2]] },
                 { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[0, 0], [5, 0]] })
// false
```

## Point in polygon

```javascript
gju.pointInPolygon({"type":"Point","coordinates":[3,3]},
                 {"type":"Polygon", "coordinates":[[[0,0],[6,0],[6,6],[0,6]]]})
// [{"type":"Point","coordinates":[3,3]}]
gju.pointInPolygon({"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1,-1]},
                 {"type":"Polygon", "coordinates":[[[0,0],[6,0],[6,6],[0,6]]]})
// false
```

## Radius filtering

If you retrieve a bunch of results from a bounding box query (common with R-tree
geo DBs), but you want to filter the rectangular result set by circular radius:

```javascript
// get the center of the original bounding box
var center = gju.rectangleCentroid({
  "type": "Polygon",
  "coordinates": [[[-122.677, 45.523], [-122.675, 45.524]]]
}),
// radius (in meters)
radius = 100;

for (var i in geometryObjectsWithinBBox) {
  if (gju.geometryWithinRadius(geometryObjectsWithinBBox[i], center, radius)) {
    // ... do stuff with objects inside the circle
  }
}
```

## Distance between two points

Uses the Haversine distance formula to calculate the distance between two points
on the Earth's curved surface (as the crow flies, no hills!). Returns the
distance in meters.

```javascript
gju.pointDistance({type: 'Point', coordinates:[-122.67738461494446, 45.52319466622903]},
                  {type: 'Point', coordinates:[-122.67652630805969, 45.52319466622903]})
// 66.86677669313518
```

## and much much more!
